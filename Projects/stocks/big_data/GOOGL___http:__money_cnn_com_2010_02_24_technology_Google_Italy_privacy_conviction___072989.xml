Italy convicts Google execs over uploaded videoNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- A judge in Milan found three Google executives guilty Wednesday of violating Italy's privacy code over a video that was uploaded on the search giant's video platform, the company said.
The video was uploaded to Google Video, prior to the company's purchase of YouTube.
Google is also being investigated by European antitrust officials, who have received complaints about the search giant's practices from three different European Internet companies.
"In essence this ruling means that employees of hosting platforms like Google Video are criminally responsible for content that users upload," Sucherman said.
All but Desikan were found guilty of the privacy charge, and the judge found all four executives not guilty of criminal defamation.
