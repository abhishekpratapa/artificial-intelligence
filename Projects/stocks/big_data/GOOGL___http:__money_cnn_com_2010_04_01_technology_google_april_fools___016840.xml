Google's April Fools' prank: We're now TopekaNEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- In the rich tradition of April Fool's Day pranks, Google has renamed itself after Topeka, Kan., accompanied by an absurd explanation from the company's chief.
0:00 / 5:04 Google vs. Apple = open vs. closedGoogle has made a name for itself as one of the more proactive pranksters in the business world.
On Thursday morning, the company's home page was titled "Topeka" instead of "Google," although still in its distinctive blue-red-yellow-green font.
April Fool's Day carries a long tradition for pranks and punks, which affect every aspect of life, from the school yard to the board room.
Because in March, Topeka Mayor Bill Bunten announced that he was informally changing the name of his town to "Google," just for one month.
