<summary>
According to online security company Arbor Networks, Google now represents an average 6.4 percent of all internet traffic.
Now, only one global ISP handles more traffic, and a lot of that traffic is Google's traffic, anyway.
This is a new record for Google, as it gained more than 1 percent of all internet traffic share since January.
(Mashable) -- The internet is growing fast, but Google is growing even faster.
The number is even more incredible if you consider that internet traffic is growing at a staggering 40 to 45 percent each year, and Google is still gaining market share.
