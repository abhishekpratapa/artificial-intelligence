Research firm Outsell has published its third annual News Users’ report, which is based on a survey about the online and offline news preferences of 2,787 US news consumers.
How many of you treat Google News like a destination for online news consumption rather than a starting point?
Says analyst Ken Doctor: “Though Google is driving some traffic to newspapers, it’s also taking a significant share away.
Interestingly enough, the research also talks of what is referred to as the “dramatic effect” aggregators like Google and Yahoo have had on print and online readership.
They’re also likelier to turn to an aggregator (31 percent) than a newspaper site (8 percent) or other site (18 percent).
